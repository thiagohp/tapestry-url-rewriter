tapestry-url-rewriter
=====================

tapestry-url-rewriter 1.0.1 is old URL rewriter API that was deprecated in Tapestry 5.2 and removed in Tapestry 5.3.

tapestry-url-rewriter 2.0.0 is 1.0.1 with all the outgoing URLs (Link instances) rewriting code,
as the Tapestry's 5.2+ LinkTransformer API handles this in a way better form.
